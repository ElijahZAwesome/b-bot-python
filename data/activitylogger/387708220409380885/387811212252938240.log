So basically Net Neutrality allows the internet to be free for everyone (aside from paying for your ISP) and doesnt allow said ISP to block sites under a paywall. Now ISPs can do that, IF ITS passed in Congress, but were hoping it will be overruled if we fight harder than ever. Help join the fight. https://www.battleforthenet.com/ will help you out. We can do this!
